# cats_dogs_classification
A binary classification project at Udemy Deep Learning Course. The dataset and original keras code was provided by https://www.superdatascience.com/ . My work;
- Realized the classification project by tensorflow
- Leveraged multi-CNN layers to improve performance
- Added Dropout to the fully connection layer
- Adopted stochastic gradient descending method with decaying learning rate
